# Skills

Skills are self-contained capability packages that the agent loads on-demand. A skill provides specialized workflows, setup instructions, helper scripts, and reference documentation for specific tasks.

Pi implements the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification), warning about most violations but remaining lenient. Pi allows skill names to differ from their parent directory even though the standard disallows it; that rule is suboptimal for shared skill directories used across multiple agent harnesses.

## Locations

> **Security:** Skills can instruct the model to perform any action and may include executable code the model invokes. Review skill content before use.

Pi loads skills from:

- Global:
  - `~/.pi/agent/skills/`
  - `~/.agents/skills/`
- Project (only after the project is trusted):
  - `.pi/skills/`
  - `.agents/skills/` in `cwd` and ancestor directories (up to git repo root, or filesystem root when not in a repo)
- Packages: `skills/` directories or `pi.skills` entries in `package.json`
- Settings: `skills` array with files or directories
- CLI: `--skill <path>` (repeatable, additive even with `--no-skills`)

Discovery rules:
- In `~/.pi/agent/skills/` and `.pi/skills/`, direct root `.md` files are discovered as individual skills
- In all skill locations, directories containing `SKILL.md` are discovered recursively
- In `~/.agents/skills/` and project `.agents/skills/`, root `.md` files are ignored

Disable discovery with `--no-skills` (explicit `--skill` paths still load).

### Using Skills from Other Harnesses

To use skills from Claude Code or OpenAI Codex, add their directories to settings:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    "~/.claude/skills",
    "~/.codex/skills"
  ]
}
```

For project-level Claude Code skills, add to `.pi/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": ["../.claude/skills"]
}
```

## How Skills Work

1. At startup, pi scans skill locations and extracts names and descriptions
2. The system prompt includes available skills in XML format per the [specification](https://agentskills.io/integrate-skills)
3. When a task matches, the agent uses `read` to load the full SKILL.md (models don't always do this; use prompting or `/skill:name` to force it)
4. The agent follows the instructions, using relative paths to reference scripts and assets

This is progressive disclosure: only descriptions are always in context, full instructions load on-demand.

## Bundled first-party skills

The coding-agent package ships six dependency-free skills under its native skills directory:

- `systematic-debugging`: adaptive reproduction, earliest-wrong-boundary tracing, root-cause correction, and focused regression verification
- `design-complex-change`: adaptive architecture and compatibility analysis for cross-package, lifecycle, migration, or public-contract changes
- `change-review`: adaptive pull request, branch, commit, or meaningful-diff review with actionable findings only
- `security-boundary-review`: adaptive trust-boundary analysis for process execution, filesystem access, permissions, secrets, packages, network access, and prompt or tool injection
- `project-context-maintenance`: adaptive, conservative updates when verified durable project guidance is missing, stale, contradictory, or misplaced
- `project-bootstrap`: manual-only repository onboarding that studies the project, asks the owner for important missing context, and creates or refreshes concise agent instructions

The first five skills are model-visible. Their descriptions are intentionally narrow so ordinary localized work can proceed without loading a skill. `project-bootstrap` sets `disable-model-invocation: true`, so it remains available through `/skill:project-bootstrap` without adding metadata to the model prompt.

Use the narrowest matching primary skill. A security review may accompany a complex design when it covers a separate trust boundary. Project-context maintenance should run only after current work establishes durable knowledge; it frequently should make no documentation change.

The package manifest registers the native skills directory, and the runtime loads it as a low-precedence package resource. Project and user skills can override bundled skills through the existing source-precedence rules. The no-skills option disables the bundled set.

## Project context lifecycle

Use the manual bootstrap skill when a repository is new, inherited, poorly documented, or substantially out of date:

```bash
/skill:project-bootstrap          # establish initial context
/skill:project-bootstrap audit    # report gaps without writing
/skill:project-bootstrap refresh  # update existing context selectively
```

Bootstrap creates the smallest useful context system. A concise root `AGENTS.md` should route future agents to deeper documents only when those documents are needed. Nested `AGENTS.md` files are appropriate only for subprojects with materially different commands, architecture, testing, security, compatibility, or ownership rules.

`project-context-maintenance` keeps that context accurate during later work. It writes only durable, verified, non-obvious, stable information with a clear scope. It must not persist secrets, temporary debugging details, speculative plans, session summaries, or facts already obvious from source code.

All-For-One automatically loads supported agent instruction files. Supporting architecture, domain, or development documents should be linked from the applicable `AGENTS.md` with a clear rule explaining when to read them; they should not be copied into permanent instructions merely to make them visible.

## Skill Commands

Skills register as `/skill:name` commands:

```bash
/skill:brave-search           # Load and execute the skill
/skill:pdf-tools extract      # Load skill with arguments
```

Arguments after the command are appended to the skill content as `User: <args>`.

Toggle skill commands via `/settings` in interactive mode or in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "enableSkillCommands": true
}
```

## Skill Structure

A skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file. Everything else is freeform.

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: frontmatter + instructions
├── scripts/              # Helper scripts
│   └── process.sh
├── references/           # Detailed docs loaded on-demand
│   └── api-reference.md
└── assets/
    └── template.json
```

### SKILL.md Format

````markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it. Be specific.
---

# My Skill

## Setup

Run once before first use:
```bash
cd /path/to/skill && npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
./scripts/process.sh <input>
```
````

Use relative paths from the skill directory:

```markdown
See [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md) for details.
```

## Frontmatter

Per the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification#frontmatter-required):

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Max 64 chars. Lowercase a-z, 0-9, hyphens. Unlike the standard, Pi does not require this to match the parent directory because that standard requirement is suboptimal for shared skill directories. |
| `description` | Yes | Max 1024 chars. What the skill does and when to use it. |
| `license` | No | License name or reference to bundled file. |
| `compatibility` | No | Max 500 chars. Environment requirements. |
| `metadata` | No | Arbitrary key-value mapping. |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Space-delimited list of pre-approved tools (experimental). |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No | When `true`, skill is hidden from system prompt. Users must use `/skill:name`. |

### Name Rules

- 1-64 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
- No leading/trailing hyphens
- No consecutive hyphens
Pi does not require the name to match the parent directory. The Agent Skills standard does, but that requirement is suboptimal for shared skill directories used by multiple tools.

Valid: `pdf-processing`, `data-analysis`, `code-review`
Invalid: `PDF-Processing`, `-pdf`, `pdf--processing`

### Description Best Practices

The description determines when the agent loads the skill. Be specific.

Good:
```yaml
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills PDF forms, and merges multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents.
```

Poor:
```yaml
description: Helps with PDFs.
```

## Validation

Pi validates skills against the Agent Skills standard. Most issues produce warnings but still load the skill:

- Name exceeds 64 characters or contains invalid characters
- Name starts/ends with hyphen or has consecutive hyphens
- Description exceeds 1024 characters

Unknown frontmatter fields are ignored.

**Exception:** Skills with missing description are not loaded.

Name collisions (same name from different locations) warn and keep the first skill found.

## Example

```
brave-search/
├── SKILL.md
├── search.js
└── content.js
```

**SKILL.md:**
````markdown
---
name: brave-search
description: Web search and content extraction via Brave Search API. Use for searching documentation, facts, or any web content.
---

# Brave Search

## Setup

```bash
cd /path/to/skill && npm install
```

## Search

```bash
./search.js "query"              # Basic search
./search.js "query" --content    # Include page content
```

## Extract Page Content

```bash
./content.js https://example.com
```
